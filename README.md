# TypeScript Exercises

A collection of beginner-friendly TypeScript exercises focusing on basic data types and operations. Each exercise includes unit tests to verify your solutions.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Running Tests

I recommend you run tests from Webstorm

You can also use CLI:

Run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode:
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Exercises

### Arrays (`src/arrays.ts`)
Practice working with array methods and operations:
- Getting first/last elements
- Summing numbers
- Filtering and mapping
- Finding maximum values
- Checking for values
- Removing duplicates

### Strings (`src/strings.ts`)
Learn string manipulation methods:
- Length and case conversion
- Checking prefixes/suffixes
- Trimming whitespace
- Replacing and splitting
- Substring operations
- String reversal

### Numbers (`src/numbers.ts`)
Work with number operations and checks:
- Even/odd detection
- Rounding operations
- Absolute values
- Positive/negative checks
- String to number conversion

### Objects (`src/objects.ts`)
Practice object manipulation:
- Getting keys and values
- Property existence checks
- Counting properties
- Copying and merging
- Removing properties
- Empty object detection

## How to Work

1. Open an exercise file (e.g., `src/arrays.ts`)
2. Read the TODO comments and implement the functions
3. Run tests to verify your solutions: `npm test`
4. All tests should pass when you've completed the exercises correctly

## Tips

- Use TypeScript's built-in methods when possible
- Pay attention to the return types specified in the function signatures
- The tests will guide you toward the expected behavior
- Don't modify the test files - only implement the functions in the main files

Good luck with your TypeScript learning!
